Airy self-healing MCP server (demo).

Three write-capable tools on top of the Airflow REST API — ``diagnose_dag``,
``fix_dag_code`` and ``rerun_dag`` — so an LLM can find a broken Dag, patch its
source, and re-run it.  Deliberately goes beyond AIP-91 phase 1 (read-only) to
show where the value ends up.

Runs as a second MCP sidecar next to the read-only ``astro-airflow-mcp``.

Env:
    AIRFLOW_API_URL      Airflow API base (default http://localhost:8080)
    AIRFLOW_USERNAME     simple-auth-manager user (default admin)
    AIRFLOW_PASSWORD     simple-auth-manager password (default admin)
    AIRY_MCP_DAGS_DIR    bundle root; also the write jail (default /files/dags)
